        <div class="essay">
            You are one of those rare people who don’t just walk into someone’s life, but you quietly become a part of
            their heart 🩷. From the first laugh we shared to the countless yapping sessions that followed, you’ve been a
            constant presence, my comfort place, even when life felt anything but. You’ve seen me at my lowest, my
            weakest, my happiest, my most confused and also my "idgaf moment" and somehow, you stayed through all of
            it without ever making
            me feel like I was too much or not enough🫠.
            <br><br>
            You have this beautiful way of making ordinary moments feel special. A random meetup of ours turns into
            therapy, a
            simple message turns into comfort, and even silence feels peaceful when it’s shared with you🤭. You listen
            without judging, support without conditions, and care without needing anything in return. That kind of
            presence isn’t common, and I hope you know how deeply it is valued. Your presence is really something which
            I can't describe in just few words... :) 
            <br><br>
            On your birthday, I don’t just wish you happiness, I wish you peace of mind (which you crave alot, most of the times),
            soft mornings, kind people around you, and dreams that don’t scare you but excite you, i really care about
            you🙂‍↔️❤️. I wish you love that feels safe, success that feels
            deserved, and a life that feels like something you don’t need a break from. You deserve so many moments that
            make
            you smile when no one is watching, and memories that feel warm even years later (I will wish these for
            you :3).
            <br><br>
            Thank you for being constant in my life and loving me at my lowest moments. Thank you for choosing me, again
            and
            again, even when it wasn’t easy. No matter where life takes us, know that you’ll always have a place in my
            heart, one that no distance, time, or change can touch. 
            <br><br>
            Happy Birthday, my favorite person, my babyy🩷🤭
